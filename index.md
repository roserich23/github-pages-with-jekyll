# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Servers

### What is a Server

A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network.

The word server is understood by most to mean a web server where web pages can be accessed over the internet through a client like a web browser. However, there are several types of servers, including local ones like file servers that store data within an intranet network.

Although any computer running the necessary software can function as a server, the most typical use of the word references the enormous, high-powered machines that function as the pumps pushing and pulling data from the internet.

Most computer networks support one or more servers that handle specialized tasks. As a rule, the larger the network in terms of clients that connect to it or the amount of data that it moves, the more likely it is that several servers play a role, each dedicated to a specific purpose.

Strictly speaking, the server is the software that handles a specific task. However, the powerful hardware that supports this software is also usually called a server because server software coordinating a network of hundreds or thousands of clients requires hardware much more robust than what you'd buy for ordinary consumer use.

### Common Types of Servers
While some dedicated servers focus on one function only, such as a print server or database server, some implementations use one server for multiple purposes.

A large, general-purpose network that supports a medium-sized company likely deploys several types of servers, including:

* __Web server__: A web server show pages and runs apps through web browsers. The server your browser is connected to right now is a web server that's delivering this page and any images you see on it. The client program, in this case, is most likely a browser like Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Safari. Web servers are used for all sorts of things in addition to delivering simple text and images, such as for uploading and backing up files online through a cloud storage service or online backup service.

* __Email server__: Email servers facilitate the sending and receiving of email messages. If you have an email client on your computer, the software is connecting to an IMAP or POP server to download your messages to your computer, and an SMTP server to send messages back through the email server.

* __FTP Server__: FTP servers support the moving of files through File Transfer Protocol tools. FTP servers are accessible remotely via FTP client programs, which connect directly to the file share on the server, either through the server's built-in FTP capabilities or with a dedicated FTP server program.

* __Identity server__: Identity servers support logins and security roles for authorized users.
